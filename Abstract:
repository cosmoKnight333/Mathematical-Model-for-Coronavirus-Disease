Abstract:
Since the Coronavirus spread started in China, scientists and
Mathematicians around the globe have been trying to predict its nature
so that they can come up with the most efficient method to handle this
epidemic. As this virus mutates to different variants with different
spreading rates, tracking its behavior is a matter of concern. As many
countries are imposing lockdowns and promoting social distancing, we
have proposed a mathematical model which will help in understanding
the effect of isolation in preventing the spread. We made the model and
presented its stability by finding the reproductive factor, Ro. For
numeration, we have used script.integrate library on python which is
based on the explicit Runge-Kutta method. Finally, we plotted
susceptible, recovered, infective, exposed for different values of the
isolation factor and observed the nature of the system.
